<h1>Automaton simulator usage instructions</h1>

<p>
This is a help file for the automaton simulator <a href="../automata/">here</a>.
It can be used to create and test deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata, regular expressions, context-free grammars, and (deterministic) Turing machines.
</p>

<p>
This application is mainly tested with the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html">Chrome</a> web browser,
and it may have problems with other web browsers.
</p>

<p>
Please send questions/bug reports to
<script language="JavaScript">
  var user = "doty";
  var organization = "ucdavis";
  var domain = "edu";
  var email = user + "@" + organization + "." + domain;
  document.write("<a href=mailto:"+email+">");
  document.write(email);
  document.write("</a>.");

<h1>How to use</h1>

Play around!
Most features are self-explanatory.
Below are some notes about aspects that may require more detailed explanation.


<h3>Entering input</h3>
<p>
    If the option "Run immediately" is selected, then all changes to input and automaton descriptions are immediately processed.
    If you uncheck this box, then a "Run" button will appear, which must be pressed to see if the automaton description is valid, and if so, what is the result of running the automaton on the input.
    This may be useful if the simulator is taking a long time to process each change, for instance if the Turing machine has an infinite loop.
</p>
<p>
    To load a text file from your computer into the editor window, click the "Choose file" button next to "Upload:".
    To save the contents of the editor to a file on your computer, click the "Download" button.
    Pressing the "Load Default" button will replace the editor with a description of the default automaton for that type.
</p>
<p>
    The contents of the editor are automatically saved locally in your browser's local storage,
    so when you first open the page,
    the editor should display the same thing you saw last time the page was open.
    <strong>However</strong>, this is merely for convenience and should not be relied upon:
    it is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> to save the file manually when you are done working.
    If the app is updated, for instance, a bug or a change in storage format may erase your stored data.
</p>

<h3 id='reset'>Clearing local storage if app does not load</h3>
<p>
    There may be rare circumstances where the app does not load due to a bug in how it loads the automaton from your browser's local storage.
    To clear local storage (which should reset the app), follow these steps.
    <ol>
    <li>Open the <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~doty/automata/">simulator web page</a>.</li>
    <li>Open Developer Tools by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I in Chrome or Firefox.</li>
    (Alternately, in Chrome click on the top right menu &rarr; More tools &rarr; Developer tools,
    and in Firefox click on the top right menu &rarr; Web Developer &rarr; Web Developer Tools.)
    <li>Once Developer Tools are open, select "Application" in Chrome or "Storage" in Firefox.</li>
    <li>Click "Local Storage" on the left.</li>
    <li>Right-click https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/ and select "Clear".</li>
    <li>Refresh the page.</li>
    </ol>
</p>


<h3>Example input files</h3>
<p>

    The easiest way to explain the input file format is by example.
    The files
    <a href="examples/no-000-end.dfa" class="tt">no-000-end.dfa</a>,
    <a href="examples/contains-010.regex" class="tt">contains-010.regex</a>,
    <a href="examples/0-three-from-end.nfa" class="tt">0-three-from-end.nfa</a>,
    <a href="examples/0s1s2s.nfa" class="tt">0s1s2s.nfa</a>,
    <a href="examples/balanced-parens.cfg" class="tt">balanced-parens.cfg</a>,
    <a href="examples/double.tm" class="tt">double.tm</a>,
    <!-- <a href="examples/double-inferred-states.tm" class="tt">double-inferred-states.tm</a>, -->
    and
    <!-- <a href="examples/w-marker-w.tm" class="tt">w-marker-w.tm</a> -->
    <a href="examples/palindrome-single-tape.tm" class="tt">palindrome-single-tape.tm</a>
    are examples of input files for the finite automata, regular expression, context-free grammar, and Turing machine simulators.
</p>

<h3>Turing machine simulation time limit</h3>
<p>
    Turing machines are run for at most 10,000 steps.
</p>

<h3>Turing machine left move on leftmost tape cell</h3>
<p>
    If a Turing machine attempts to move a tape head left when it is already
    on the leftmost tape cell, then the tape head stays where it is instead.
</p>

<h3>Step-by-step simulation</h3>
<p>
    The finite automata and Turing machine simulators have a back and forward
    button to step through individual transitions of the machine.
    In both cases the current state is highlighted.
    In the case of Turing machines, the tape(s) are shown with the tape head
    position(s) highlighted.
</p>

<p>
    In the case of finite automata, the input is shown with a caret symbol
    <label class="tt">^</label> placed in between the symbol just read and the
    symbol about to be read.
    For example, in reading the string <label class="tt">0010</label>, the
    finite automaton will have four transitions and visit five states total,
    with the "read position" being indicated in each case as:
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li><label class="tt">^0 0 1 0 </label></li>
        <li><label class="tt">&nbsp;0^0 1 0 </label></li>
        <li><label class="tt">&nbsp;0 0^1 0 </label></li>
        <li><label class="tt">&nbsp;0 0 1^0 </label></li>
        <li><label class="tt">&nbsp;0 0 1 0^</label></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    If the input field and editor are not selected,
    then the <label class="tt">,</label> and <label class="tt">.</label>
    (comma and period) keys can
    also be used to do forward and backward transitions. This can be useful
    to quickly jump several transitions ahead by holding down the key.
</p>

<h3>Output conventions for Turing machines</h3>
<p>
    Turing machines have two different notions of "output".

    <ol>
      <li>
          <em>Boolean</em> output, which is indicated by whether the final
          configuration is in the accept state or the reject state.
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <em>string</em> output, used to define Turing machines that compute
          functions f: &Sigma;<sup>*</sup> &rarr; &Sigma;<sup>*</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The string output in the final configuration is represented on the <em>last</em> tape.
          The output is defined to be the string
          from the tape head to the first blank to the right (represented by an underscore
          <label class="tt">_</label>), not including the blank.
          This means that although the input is from the input alphabet, the
          output could have nonblank symbols from the tape alphabet.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, suppose the content of the last tape is
          <label class="tt">bb_bbabbaba_abb_bbb__</label>
          and the tape head at the leftmost
          <label class="tt">a</label>.
          Then the output string is
          <label class="tt">abbaba</label>.

          If the content of the last tape is
          <label class="tt">_abbaba_abb_bbb__</label>
          and the tape head is at position 0
          (in other words, if the tape head is scanning a blank symbol),
          then the output string is the empty string &epsilon;.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h3>Notes about file format</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
      Whitespace is mostly ignored.
      Since whitespace otherwise gets trimmed away, whitespace characters cannot be in any alphabet.
  </li>

    </br>
    <li>
        State names can be multi-character strings, with characters that are either alphanumeric,
        an underscore <div class="tt">_</div>,
        a hyphen <div class="tt">-</div>,
        parentheses <div class="tt">(</div> and <div class="tt">)</div>,
        or a prime (apostophe) <div class="tt">'</div>.
        Alphabet symbols should be single characters, which can be any symbol from the keyboard except for the following,
        which have special syntactical meaning in the automata files:
        <ul>
          <!--
          <li>
              forward slash <div class="tt">/</div>, since two of them in a row indicate a comment
          </li>
          -->
          <li>
              curly braces <div class="tt">{</div> and <div class="tt">}</div>, used to enclose sets
          </li>
          <li>
              comma <div class="tt">,</div>, used to separate lists of items (such as each state in the set of states)
          </li>
          <li>
              pipe <div class="tt">|</div>, used for nondeterministic productions in CFGs and union in Regex's (this only applies to CFG and Regex symbols; DFA, NFA, and TM can use <div class="tt">|</div> as an alphabet symbol)
          </li>
          <li>
              question mark <div class="tt">?</div>, used as a special character for Turing machine wildcard transition rules
          </li>
          <li>
              whitespace characters (e.g., space, tab, newline)
          </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    </br>
    <li>
      In regular expressions, only the following characters are allowed:
      the operators
      <label class="tt">( ) * + |</label>,
      alphanumeric characters,
      and (because of a homework problem involving email addresses)
      the characters
      <label class="tt">.</label>
      and
      <label class="tt">@</label>.
      Note that <label class="tt">|</label> is used to mean &cup;.
      Unlike most regular expression libraries in programming languages, <em>spaces are ignored</em> (including newlines),
      which can help you to visually separate different parts of the regular expression.
      <p>
        <strong>
            Warning:
        </strong>
        Comments are poorly supported in regular expressions.
        If you are having trouble, try removing all comments.
    </p>
    </li>

    </br>
    <li>
        The various parts of the automaton (<div class="tt">states</div>, <div class="tt">input_alphabet</div>, etc.) must be specified in the same order given in the example files.
    </li>

    </br>
    <li>
      <div class="tt">.nfa</div> files are almost the same syntax as <div class="tt">.dfa</div> files, with two exceptions:
      <ul>
        <li>
            You can write
            <div class="tt">q, -> r;</div>
            to represent an &epsilon;-transition from state <div class="tt">q</div> to <div class="tt">r</div>.
            See <a href="examples/0s1s2s.nfa" class="tt">0s1s2s.nfa</a> for an example.
        </li>

        <li>
            You can write
            <div class="tt">q,0 -> {r,s,t};</div>
            to represent a nondeterministic transition to any of states <div class="tt">r,s,t</div>
            (from state <div class="tt">q</div> while reading a <div class="tt">0</div>).
            See <a href="examples/0-three-from-end.nfa" class="tt">0-three-from-end.nfa</a> for an example.
            You can also write several lines to specify multiple output states, such as
            <br/>
            <div class="tt">q,0 -> r;</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="tt">q,0 -> s;</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="tt">q,0 -> t;</div>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    </br>
    <li>
        <p>
        <div class="tt">.regex</div> files can define variables with subexpressions. For example 
        <br/>
        <div class="tt">A = 0|1;</div>
        <br/>
        <div class="tt">B = A2;</div>
        <br/>
        <div class="tt">34B | 56A</div>
        <br/>
        is equivalent to the regex <div class="tt">34((0|1)2) | 56(0|1)</div>.
        Each subexpression may reference previous variables.
        The last expression appears after the last semicolon (with no variable definition or equals sign).
        This can help with avoiding typing long subexpressions multiple times.
        Also, you can use longer variable names for subexpressions, which is helpful when the input alphabet contains all single letters. It will not work properly to use single-letter variable names such as A or b in this case.
        For example
        <br/>
        <div class="tt">Sigma = q|w|e|r|t|y|u|i|o|p|a|s|d|f|g|h|j|k|l|z|x|c|v|b|n|m|Q|W|E|R|T|Y|U|I|O|P|A|S|D|F|G|H|J|K|L|Z|X|C|V|B|N|M;</div>
        <br/>
        <div class="tt">Sigma* abc Sigma* abc Sigma* abc Sigma*</div>
        <br/>
        matches any word with three appearances of <div class="tt">abc</div> in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Warning:
            </strong>
            Do not use newlines within a subexpression. Most of the automata simulator is robust to newlines, but using newlines within a subexpression will put the symbols <tt>\n</tt> into your final regex. Put each subexpression on a single line.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, be careful with this feature!
        It works by simply substituting each subexpression in all the remaining ones.
        So it is possible (and inadvisable) to write a short regex that will blow up the memory requirements exponentially,
        e.g.,
        <br/>
        <div class="tt">A = 0123456789;</div>
        <br/>
        <div class="tt">B = AAAAAAAAAA;</div>
        <br/>
        <div class="tt">C = BBBBBBBBBB;</div>
        <br/>
        <div class="tt">D = CCCCCCCCCC;</div>
        <br/>
        <div class="tt">E = DDDDDDDDDD;</div>
        <br/>
        <div class="tt">F = EEEEEEEEEE;</div>
        <br/>
        <div class="tt">G = FFFFFFFFFF;</div>
        <br/>
        <div class="tt">G</div>
        <br/>
        which defines a regular expression with ten million symbols in it.
        </p>
    </li>
    
    </br>
    <li>
        <div class="tt">.cfg</div> files use character
        <div class="tt">|</div> to represent multiple production rules on the same line, e.g.
        <div class="tt">S -> A|B;</div> is equivalent to
        <div class="tt">S -> A;</div> and <div class="tt">S -> B;</div>.
        Note that an &epsilon;-production can be included by, e.g.,
        <div class="tt">S -> A|;</div>
        which is equivalent to
        <div class="tt">S -> A;</div> and <div class="tt">S -> ;</div>
    </li>

  <!-- </br>
  <li>
      For a TM only (not for DFA/NFA),
      if the line defining the states is
      <div class="tt">states: ?</div>
      then the simulator will infer the names of the states from the transition function and accept/reject/start states.
      See <a href="examples/double-inferred-states.tm" class="tt">double-inferred-states.tm</a> for an example.
      An advantage of listing the states explicitly is that the transition rows are are listed in the order given by the states.
      If the states are inferred, the the rule is: start state is listed first, accept and reject listed last,
      and other states are listed in the order in which they first appear as the <em>input</em> to the transition function,
      and any states that are a transition function output, but never an input, are listed at the end just before the accept/reject states.
  </li> -->

  </br>
  <li>
      A k-tape TM is specified with transition rules using strings of length k for
      the input symbols, the output symbols, and moves.
      For example, the transition rule <div class="tt">q,001 -> r,111,RSL;</div>
      is for a 3-tape TM and specifies that
      in state <div class="tt">q</div>,
      reading a <div class="tt">0</div> on the first tape,
      a <div class="tt">0</div> on the second tape,
      and a <div class="tt">1</div> on the third tape,
      the TM should change to state <div class="tt">r</div>,
      write a <div class="tt">1</div> on the first tape
      and move its tape head right,
      a <div class="tt">1</div> on the second tape
      and don't move its tape head,
      and a <div class="tt">1</div> on the third tape
      and move its tape head left.
  </li>

  </br>
  <li>
      DFA transition functions must be defined explicitly on all inputs.
      In other words, if you have |Q|=k states
      and |&Sigma;|=m symbols, there must be exactly k&middot;m transitions for
      &delta;, one for each pair (q,b), where q &isin; Q and b &isin; &Sigma;.
  </li>

  </br>
  <li>
      In contrast, NFA and TM transition functions do not need to be fully specified;
      they take default values for any inputs not specified.
      If &Delta;(q,b) is left unspecified for an NFA, then it is assumed &Delta;(q,b) = &#216;.
      If &delta;(q,b) is left unspecified for a TM, then it is assumed
      &delta;(q,b) = (q<sub>r</sub>,b,S), where q<sub>r</sub> is the reject state.
      <!-- transition to the reject state, leaving the tape symbol(s) as they are, and not moving the tape head(s). -->
  </li>


  </br>
  <li>
      The files
      <a href="examples/count-a-wildcard.tm" class="tt">count-a-wildcard.tm</a>
      and
      <a href="examples/w-marker-w-wildcard.tm" class="tt">w-marker-w-wildcard.tm</a>
      show how to use the wildcard symbol <div class="tt">?</div>
      to avoid typing many transitions that do the same thing.
      The symbol matching the wildcard can either be written over
      (if a non-wildcard symbol appears in the output, e.g., <div class="tt">q,0? -> r,11,RS;</div>)
      or copied
      (if <div class="tt">?</div> appears in the output, e.g., <div class="tt">q,0? -> r,1?,RS;</div>).
      For each tape, if a wildcard appears as an output, then it must also appear as an input for the same tape,
      and in this case it means "copy whatever symbol matched the wildcard in the input".
      For example, the following is not allowed:
      <div class="tt">q,00 -> r,1?,RS;</div>.

      </br></br>

      If there is a wildcard-containing transition that matches
      a wildcard-free transition, the latter takes precedence. For example,
      <a href="examples/count-a-wildcard.tm" class="tt">count-a-wildcard.tm</a>
      uses the wildcard-free transitions
      <div class="tt">q1,a_ -> q1,a0,RR;</div>
      and
      <div class="tt">q1,__ -> qA,__,SS;</div>,
      if they match, before using the wildcard transition
      <div class="tt">q1,?_ -> q1,?_,RS;</div>.

      </br></br>

      In fact, it is required to use this feature if there is a state <div class="tt">q</div> such that
      two wildcard transitions with input state <div class="tt">q</div>
      <em>overlap</em>, in the sense that they both match the same tuple of input symbols.
      For example,
      <div class="tt">q,0?1 -> r,111,RS;</div>
      and
      <div class="tt">q,??1 -> t,000,LL;</div>
      both match tuples
      <div class="tt">001</div>
      and
      <div class="tt">011</div>.
      To disambiguate what to do if
      <div class="tt">001</div>
      or
      <div class="tt">011</div>
      is encountered when in state <div class="tt">q</div>,
      there must be wildcard-free transitions with input state <div class="tt">q</div>
      for both
      <div class="tt">001</div>
      and
      <div class="tt">011</div>.
      Thus the case above would be an error if there were not also transitions of the form
      <div class="tt">q,001 -> ...</div>
      and
      <div class="tt">q,011 -> ...</div>.

  </li>

  </ul>
